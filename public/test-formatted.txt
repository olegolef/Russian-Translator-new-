ABOUT THE AUTHOR

The Osho teachings defy categorization, covering everything from the individual quest for meaning to the most urgent social and political issues facing society today. His books are not written but are transcribed from audio and video recordings of extemporaneous talks given to international audiences over a period of 35 years.

Osho has been described by The Sunday Times in London as one of the "1000 Makers of the 20th Century" and by American author Tom Robbins as "the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ." The Sunday Mid-Day (India) has selected Osho as one of ten people—along with Gandhi, Nehru and Buddha—who have changed the destiny of India.

About the Author

Osho is also known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and the Master of Masters. He was born in Kuchwada, Madhya Pradesh, India, on December 11, 1931. From his earliest childhood, he was a rebellious and independent spirit, questioning all social, religious and philosophical traditions of the society around him.

After his enlightenment at the age of twenty-one, Osho completed his academic studies and spent several years teaching philosophy at the University of Jabalpur. Meanwhile, he traveled throughout India, giving talks, challenging orthodox religious leaders in public debate, questioning traditional beliefs, and meeting people from all walks of life.

He began initiating disciples (sannyasins) in 1970 and established the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune, India, in 1974. The resort welcomes thousands of international visitors who come to participate in its meditation, therapy and creative programs, and to experience the famous Osho Active Meditations.

Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.
